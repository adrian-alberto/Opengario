# Opengario
Incomplete open-source agar.io clone.  
Runs using [LOVE2d](http://love2d.org/)

Currently has blob deformation, springy blob-physics, blob devouring, and friction.  
Use WASD to control blob. Blobs of comparable size will push off of each other.
Blobs of differing size will devour each other.
